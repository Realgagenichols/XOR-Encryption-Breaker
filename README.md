Certainly! Here's an example of a README file for your XOR encryption program:

```
# XOR Encryption Program

This program provides functionalities for XOR encryption and decryption. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt text or files using a given key, as well as break XOR encryption when the key is unknown.

## Features

- Encryption: Encrypts text or files using XOR encryption with a given key.
- Decryption: Decrypts text or files using XOR decryption with a given key.
- Key Breaker: Attempts to break XOR encryption by trying different keys and selecting the one that produces the most English-like decrypted text.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```shell
python xor_cipher.py <mode> <input_data> [<key>]
```

- `<mode>`: The mode of operation. Available modes are `encrypt`, `decrypt`, and `break`.
- `<input_data>`: The input text or file to be encrypted, decrypted, or broken.
- `<key>` (optional): The encryption or decryption key.

### Examples

Encrypting a text file:

```shell
python xor_cipher.py encrypt plaintext.txt mykey
```

Decrypting a file:

```shell
python xor_cipher.py decrypt encrypted.bin mykey
```

Breaking XOR encryption:

```shell
python xor_cipher.py break encrypted.bin
```
